# Description

Contains scripts and notes on various software (games, tools, linux, ...).  
Serves as a back-up and centralization for all my tuning/tweaking needs.

# Markdown Documentation
I don't know where to put this, so here it is.

## Highlighting box
highlights a text by framing it in an element with an icon.  
Useful for writing a Wiki.  

> [ℹ️](# "Info")  
> Add details or a context to something.  
> This box can be expanded with several lines.

> [⚠️](# "Alert")  
> Warns or prevent potential consequences

> [⛔️](# "Forbidden")  
> Indicate that something is impossible or not advised

> [✅](# "Tips")  
> Add another way of doing things or give details on how to use

> [🚧](# "In Progress")  
> Indicate that the information needs to be finished or reworked

To add this box, you can use this notation :  
```markdown
              current page
add anchor ─────┐  │    ┌──────  tooltip
            > [ℹ️](# "Info")
            > Text here
```
