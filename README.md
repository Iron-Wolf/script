# Description

Contains scripts and notes on various software (games, tools, linux, ...).  
Serves as a back-up and centralization for all my tuning/tweaking needs.

# Markdown Documentation
I don't know where to put this, so here it is.

## Highlighting box
Highlights a text by framing it in an element with an icon.  
Useful for writing a Wiki.  
This was inspired by some cool documentation, like [Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#using.devtools).
